# Credit Card Payment Default Prediction using anomaly
Credit card is a flexible tool by which a customer can use a bank's money for a short period of time.

Predicting accurately which customers are most probable to default represents a significant business 
opportunity for all banks. Bank cards are the most common credit card type in Taiwan, which 
emphasizes the impact of risk prediction on both the consumers and banks.

This would inform the bank’s decisions on criteria to approve a credit card application and also decide 
upon what credit limit to provide.

This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of 
payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

Using the information given, predict the probability of a customer defaulting in the next month.
